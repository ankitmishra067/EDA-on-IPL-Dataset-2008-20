Exploratory Data Analysis on IPL data (2008 - 2020). Finding insights and patterns in data

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is an approach to analyze the data using visual techniques. It is used to discover trends, patterns, or to check assumptions with the help of statistical summary and graphical representations

The primary objective of any EDA process is to analyse the underlying structure of a dataset which can help in insight generation.

Components of EDA
There are main components of exploring data:

    Understanding your variables
    Cleaning your dataset
    Analyzing relationships between variables

Steps Involved in Exploratory Data Analysis[EDA]

    Data Collection
    Data Cleaning
    Univariate Analysis
    Bivariate Analysis

Repository Overview
This repository is about EDA performed on Indian Premier League Data available between 2008 - 2018.

It has a python notebook where all the coding has been done
It also has the relevant datasets used for this analysis
Brief Overview of the steps followed in this project
There are 2 datasets used for the analysis. 'IPL Matches 2008-2020.csv' dataset gives information on all the matches played in IPL between 2008 and 2020 i.e. information on the following:

Season
Venue
City
Teams
Winner
Toss Winner
Winning margin
Umpires

On the other hand 'IPL Ball-by-Ball 2008-2020.csv' dataset gives ball by ball information on every match played during 2008 - 2020.
i.e. information on the following:


Runs scored per ball
Extras by bowlers/fielding team
Wickets taken
Types of dismissals
Venue It basically provides individual records of players.

The entire EDA process was broken down into 2 high level topics to find answers to the problem statement

    Univariate Analysis (analysing individual attributes)
    Bivariate Analysis (analysing 2 attributes together)

However, before analysing, Profiling and processing of data was undertaken. After finding patterns and relationships in the data, EDA process was concluded with few conclusions as derived while analysing. Along with concluding insights, few actionable items were also suggested which could help in better performance of players or auctioning of players, etc.
